<p class="pl-md-5 pr-md-5 animated fadeInLeft delay-1000">The system will be locked before the process starts and opened for counting by the designated official of <b>ORGANIZATION/ CLIENT/ ELECTION OFFICER</b>. The log reports will be saved from the server and handed over to you; this is to ensure no unauthorized access has been made to the server.</p>
<p class="pl-md-5 pr-md-5 animated fadeInLeft delay-1000">Help Desk support will be provided from <b>ORGANIZATION/ CLIENT </b>wherein they handle all the queries and in case if needed, the emails will be sent again to the voters who have not recorded the same or have deleted by mistake. The emails will be sent again after cross checking from our end, whether the ballot is casted or not.</p>
<p class="pl-md-5 pr-md-5 animated fadeInLeft delay-1000">Email Support: The emailing for the first time at the launch of system along with the repeat mailing as instructed by the help desk in charge will be handled from our end.</p>
