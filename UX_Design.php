<h1 class="heading animated bounceInUp"><span class="back-light">What is UX and why it Matters?</span></h1>
<p class="pt-3 pl-md-5 pr-md-5 animated fadeInLeft delay-1000">User Experience (UX) is how a user feels on interacting with your digital product – be it a website, <a class="font700 font15 blueColor" href="<?php echo $this->config->base_url();?>web-application-development-service-company">web application</a>, mobile app or any other product. UX encompasses several factors like design/aesthetics, functionality, ergonomics, usability, utility, accessibility, performance and the overall experience.<span class="expandTextMobile"></span></p>
<div class="expandContentMobile">
<p class="pl-md-5 pr-md-5 animated fadeInLeft delay-1000">But, UX isn’t just about the technical performance. It’s much more than that. It’s about the emotion, connection, intuition, and experience a person feels on using your website or product. It matters as much (or even more) than the visual appeal of a product.It doesn’t help even if you have a <a class="font700 font15 blueColor" href="<?php echo $this->config->base_url();?>mobile-web-design-company">stunning website or app</a> if your users don’t know or find it difficult to interact with it.</p>
<p class="pl-md-5 pr-md-5  animated fadeInLeft delay-1000">Here, at Finessse Interactive, our UX design team not only ensures that your target audiences use your product without any hassles. But these experts make sure that your customers enjoy the interaction with your product.</p>
<p class="pl-md-5 pr-md-5 font700 font18 animated fadeInLeft delay-1000 blueColor">Our UX Design Solutions </p>
<p class="pl-md-5 pr-md-5  animated fadeInLeft delay-1000">We believe that a neat, optimized and clutter-free approach to design is the best way to connect with your customers. Our diverse team of UX designers concentrates on two key factors - user empathy and attention to detail.</p>
<p class="pl-md-5 pr-md-5  animated fadeInLeft delay-1000">We begin by understanding your business goals, user situations, and the possible solutions. We then rely on our comprehensive groundwork and research to create wireframes and prototypes that we refine in successive iterations, continually making changes until we strike the perfect balance between – design and functionality. Through a series of repeated testing and optimization, we arrive at a UX design – that has a high impact to connect and engage with your audience.<span class="minusTextMobile"></span></p></div>
